# WorldVax.ui

A simple Apache Cordova app that responds to the deviceready event.

## Dependencies
### 1. Node.js
Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Following installation, you should be able to invoke node and npm on your command line.

### 2. Git
Download and install a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) client. Following installation, you should be able to invoke git on your command line. Even though you won't be using git manually, the CLI does use it behind-the-scenes to download some assets when creating a new project.

## Install
You may wish to install some of the dependencies globally:
'''
sudo npm install -g bower cordova
'''
Otherwise running the following command in the project root will install the remaining dependencies:
'''
npm install
'''

Run`npm start` to launch a webserver and point your browser at `http://localhost:8000/www/index.html` to view the web app.
